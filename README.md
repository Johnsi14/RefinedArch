# Refined Arch Distribution

An easy to use distribution based on Arch Linux, designed to be easy to use and customisable for people using Linux for the first time.

## Aim

- Convert, edit config files and install fonts and packages, but also manage them as a GUI task.
- Easily distribute and download your favourite configs and merge differences from other peoples configs into your config without completely overwriting your config.
- Make the process of debugging and troubleshooting easy for others by having scripts that grab the relevant logs.
- Simplify the process of using the computer, while still allowing full customisation for those who want it.
- Make it easier to transfer your operating system to another PC or to restore the OS after something has gone wrong.

## Who is it for?

It is designed for people who have never used Linux before or who just want a hassle-free Linux experience. It can be used by more experienced users, but if you don't like having linux made easier and like doing things manually

## Status

It is in no way ready for use.
